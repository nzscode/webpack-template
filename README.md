            const path = require("path");
            
            module.exports = {
                entry: "./src/index.js",
                plugins: [
                    new HtmlWebpackPlugin({
                        scriptLoading: "blocking",
                        template: "./src/index.html",

                    filename: "main.js",
                    path: path.resolve(__dirname, "dist"),
                    clean: true,
                },
                module: {
                    rules: [
                        {
                            test: /\.css$/i,
                            use: ["style-loader", "css-loader"],
                        },
                    ],
                },
            };


11. To setup webpack to manage HTML: npm install --save-dev html-webpack-plugin
12. In package.json add a comma at the end of "scripts: { "test":... , "build":
    webpack", ...}
13. In the src folder create a style.css file
14. Make sure the necessary rules are in webpack.config.js for css
    1. Install the files needed to run CSS & Styles: npm install --save-dev
       css-loader style-loader
15. Import the css file into the index.js file using : import "./style.css" at
    the top of the file
16. To complete basic Build, npx webpack OR npm run build
17. for adding images, fonts, json, data. See:
    https://webpack.js.org/guides/asset-management/

18. To test if working, add boilerplate to src> index.html and a console.log
    statement to index.js For css testing, add a div componenet nad change its
    color to something using js then save each individual file and run npm run
    build

19. To publish the files through GitHub:

    ```
    git add dist && git commit -m "Initial dist subtree commit"
    ```

    
    ```
    git subtree push --prefix dist origin gh-pages
    ```

    3.  If you already have a "gh-pages" branch, use the 1st command below.

        -   If you don't have a "gh-pages" branch, initialize it by using the
            2nd command below.
        -   Make it easier to run by creating scripts like these in your
            package.json file:

            ```js
            "scripts":
                {
                "gh-deploy": "git push origin :gh-pages && git subtree push --prefix dist origin gh-pages",
                "gh-deploy-init": "git push origin && git subtree push --prefix dist origin gh-pages"
                }
            ```
   
            

        \-In terminal:
```bash
            npm run gh-deploy
            npm run gh-deploy-init
```



4.  In your repository in GitHub. Go to Settings. Go to Pages.
    \-   Under the Source section you will see a dropdown list of branches.
    \-   Select the "gh-pages" branch and select the root as your folder.
    \-   Then click Save.



## Adding Font-Awesome Icons to element
- When creating the element:
      - add the font-awesome code to the inner code of the element
      Ex:
  
  ```js
  let deleteBtn = document.createElemnt("div");
  deleteBtn.innerHTML = `<i class="fa-solid fa-trash-can"></i>` ``     ```

To the index.html page of the src folder add the script from the kit

        ```html
        <script src="https://kit.fontawesome.com/08988bcf09.js" crossorigin="anonymous"></script>
        ```


## If at any point you have issues where when


    ```bash
    npx webpack
    ```


you get an error child something, try this:


```bash
sudo npm cache clean -f
sudo npm install -g n
sudo n stable
sudo n latest
```
